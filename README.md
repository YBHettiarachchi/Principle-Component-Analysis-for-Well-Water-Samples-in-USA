# Principle-Component-Analysis-for-Well-Water-Samples-in-USA

Study based on metal chemical constituents of 92 drinking well water samples from Maine and New Hampshire, USA.
Samples collected as part of NIGMS SEPA project "Data to Action," involving students and teachers as citizen scientists.
Sampling protocol includes running cold water tap, collecting 50 mL water, and freezing samples for 24 hours.
Metadata collected includes collector's name, location of well, type of well, previous testing information, etc.
Samples tested for various metals including Arsenic, Antimony, Barium, Beryllium, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Lead, Manganese, Nickel, Selenium, Tallium, and Uranium.

Research objectives include,
(i) Summarize eleven chemical components into subgroups.
(ii) Cluster well water samples into homogeneous groups based on mixture components.
(iii) Ensure chemical mixtures align with standard accepted values in well water samples (USA standards).
